>>>>>>> Created a new form for creating cards, made changes to modify form. Messed around with the home form a bit, and made some mistakes :( I tries to not commit the changes I made to home form, but not sure if it'll work. Messed around with the code of the modify and create forms, tried to connect it to the database, tried to make the buttons functionable. But I still need to work on it cuz I messed up again. So ya'll will be able to see just the nonfunctional form. Buttons probably don't work.
